Computer hardware will check when overflow occurs, but do programming languages check for this?  In this assignment you will write a C program and a Python program that does an operation that results in an overflow.

Programming langauges do not check for this, it is up to the programmer to handle these situations and check for overflow.
In the case of Python, the behavior of integer overflow is platform dependent. In Python3, the int class
has no upper limit. In C, we can see the overflow occur.
